                <div class="chapter-body">
                  <span style="color:#085197;font-weight:700"><p>Americans often look at businesses impersonally. We think of them as lifeless entities that earn profits and don’t do much else. When we think of businesses this way, it becomes very easy to think that business taxes are somehow different than other taxes.</p>
                  <p>But the reality is that businesses are simply groups of people; they are workers, consumers, and shareholders.</p></span>
                  <p>This means that when we tax businesses, we actually tax people; workers through lower wages, consumers through higher prices, and shareholders through lower returns. Furthermore, the majority of businesses are, in fact, a person that the tax code treats as a business.</p>
                  <p>In the United States, we place a heavy tax burden on businesses. Our corporations face the highest tax rate and the most burdensome international tax rules in the developed world. Our non-corporate businesses face high tax rates, too, reaching above 50 percent in some states. Furthermore, our tax code actively discourages investment by double taxing that investment at high rates.</p>
                  <p>America’s high-tax environment stifles the economy and makes work and investment more expensive. This is bad for long-term prosperity.</p>
                  <p>The good news is that there is a solution. Tax reform that lowers taxes on businesses and investment can create jobs, increase incomes, and lead to higher living standards.</p>
                  <p>This book is your visual guide to business taxes in America. It discusses the vast array of business types and sizes, the sectors of the economy they serve, and the effects of taxes on U.S. businesses and the people who build, create, and maintain them.</p>

In 1929, Illinois’ personal income per person sat at 136 percent of the U.S. level, with all neighboring states trailing. By 2013, the gap between Illinois and its neighbors had decreased substantially as Illinois’ per person income declined to 105 percent of the U.S. average.'],

Property taxes, income taxes, and sales taxes are well known, but other revenue sources include excise taxes, the estate tax, a tax on capital stock (known as the franchise tax), and funding from the federal government, among others.',
            'In general, Illinoisans face a high state and local tax burden. Inflation-adjusted tax collections have risen over time, from $17.4 billion in 1961 to $66.5 billion in 2011. The composition of those collections has changed as well. The local share of collections has become smaller, and the state share has increased.',
            'While the level of taxes levied matters, the structure of each tax is equally important. Each tax type has pros and cons, and each can contribute to or detract from a state’s overall tax climate. Similarly, other budgetary issues, such as federal funding levels and unfunded liabilities, should also be kept in mind when evaluating a state’s revenue structure.']

As of 2015, the Illinois rate is one of the lowest in the country at 3.75 percent. This has positive implications for both individual and business taxpayers.',
            'Illinois lawmakers responded to the most recent recession with an individual income tax increase, which began to sunset at the end of 2014. Prior to this, the Illinois rate had generally seen an upward trend over time (except for brief fluctuations in the 1980s). ',
            'But rates are only one component of the overall tax structure—the tax base matters too. Illinois has many high-cost individual income tax expenditures that carve away at the income tax base. The most notable is the expenditure for retirement income, which amounted to $2.23 billion in 2013.',
            'The 2011 rate increase had one striking result: Illinois’ individual income tax collections per person in 2012 were higher than the all-state average. This was a recent change, however. Prior to 2011 and at least as far back as the late 1970s, Illinois’ collections per person had always been below the U.S. average.']

In Illinois, businesses paid $32.3 billion in total taxes in 2013, primarily toward taxes other than the corporate income tax (the most recognizable type of business tax). In reality, many firms are pass-through entities such as limited liability companies (LLCs), S-corporations, and sole proprietorships that pay individual income taxes rather than corporate income taxes. Businesses also pay property, sales, and excise taxes, among others.',
            'Illinois’ business tax structure has several flaws. Not only is the corporate income tax rate comparatively high both regionally and nationally, the state has many business incentives that carve away at the tax base. Additional detrimental features exist, including application of the sales tax to several business inputs, lack of horizontal equity, and existence of a capital stock tax (a tax that most states have eliminated).']

            'The shrinking sales tax base is not unique to Illinois. States tend to levy sales taxes on goods, even though the services sector now makes up a much larger share of the economy than when sales tax statutes were written in the 1930s. Over time, the decreasing tax base has contributed to the stagnation of sales tax collections per person in Illinois, even as the rate has increased.']
