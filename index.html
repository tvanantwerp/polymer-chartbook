Many people typically think of pass-through businesses as small businesses, and in many cases, they are. There is a good chance that your local laundromat, neighborhood restaurant, your employer, or even your own business organizes as a pass-through.',
            'This doesn’t mean that all pass-throughs are small businesses, though. In some cases, pass-through businesses are very large, with tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of employees and billions of dollars in revenue.',
            'So what makes a business a pass-through entity? This is determined by how owners of the business elect to structure their ownership stake and pay the business’s taxes. When a pass-through business earns a profit, the business does not send the check for the tax to the IRS. Instead, the profit is passed through the business and onto the tax returns of the owners of the business. The owners then write the check and pay the tax to the IRS.',
            'This means that these businesses pay taxes through the individual tax code, so changes to the individual tax code directly impact them. In fact, recent changes pushed the top tax rate on pass-through businesses above 50 percent in some states.',
            'Any tax reform proposal needs to consider how changes to the individual tax code impact pass-through businesses, which earn a majority of today’s business income.']

            'A: Pass-through entities get their name from the way they are taxed. When a pass-through business earns a profit, the business does not pay the tax. Instead, the profit is passed through the business to the business owner’s tax return. The owner then writes the check and pays the tax to the IRS. This means that for tax purposes, pass-through businesses and all their income face the same marginal tax rates as individuals.',
            'Q: How many times do pass-throughs pay taxes?',
            'A: Unlike C corporations, which pay two layers of taxes—once at the corporate level and once at the shareholder level—pass-through businesses only face one layer of taxation, which is paid by the business owner.',
            'Q: Are there different types of pass-through businesses?',
            'A: There are multiple types of pass-through entities. The types of pass-through entities include S corporations, sole proprietorships, and partnerships (such as LLCs).',
            'Q: What taxes do pass-through businesses pay?',
            'A: Pass-through entities pay their income taxes at individual income tax rates through their owners’ tax returns. The top federal income tax rate faced by pass-through entities is 39.6 percent. Pass-through businesses also pay self-employment taxes and state and local income taxes.',
            'Q: Are pass-throughs and small businesses the same?',
            'A: While many small businesses tend to organize as pass-through businesses, not all pass-through businesses are small. In some cases, pass-through businesses are very large, with tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of employees, and billions of dollars in revenue.'],
