                  <p>Taxes are complicated. Each state’s tax code is a multifaceted system with many moving parts, and Illinois is no exception. This chart book aims to help readers understand Illinois’ overall economy and tax system from a broad perspective. It also provides detailed illustrations of each of Illinois’ major tax types—individual income taxes, business taxes, sales and excise taxes, and property taxes—to help make the complicated task of understanding the state’s tax code a bit easier.</p>
                  <p>These charts were compiled by Tax Foundation staff and edited by economist Liz Malm.</p>

                  <p>The <a href="http://taxfoundation.org">Tax Foundation</a> is the nation’s leading independent tax policy research organization. Since 1937, our principled research, insightful analysis, and engaged experts have informed smarter tax policy at the federal, state, and local levels. Our Center for State Tax Policy is routinely relied upon for presentations, testimony, and media appearances on state tax and fiscal policy, and our website is a comprehensive resource for information on tax and spending policy in each U.S. state.</p>
                  <h2>About the Taxpayers’ Federation of Illinois and the Illinois Fiscal Policy Council</h2>
                  <p>The Illinois Fiscal Policy Council was created in 1981 by the Taxpayers’ Federation of Illinois, the state’s most respected nonpartisan state and local tax and fiscal policy advocacy organization. The Council is a charitable foundation focusing on state and local government finance, particularly issues relating to how Illinois taxes its citizens and businesses. Its educational materials, studies, and other research papers are geared toward and available to the public, elected officials, and the media.</p>
